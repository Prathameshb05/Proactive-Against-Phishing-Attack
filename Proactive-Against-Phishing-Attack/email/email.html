        INFORMATION
    </h1><br><br>
    <p>Email phishing is a malicious online activity that involves the use of deceptive
        emails
        to trick recipients
        into taking
        actions that can compromise their security, personal information, or financial assets. Phishers send
        emails
        that appear
        to be from trusted sources, such as banks, government agencies, or well-known companies. These emails
        often
        use official
        logos, branding, and email addresses that mimic the legitimate organization. Phishing emails use
        psychological
        manipulation techniques to create a sense of urgency or fear, telling recipients that their account will
        be
        suspended,
        that they have won a prize, or that they need to verify personal information.

        These deceptive emails often contain links that lead to fake websites designed to steal login
        credentials or
        personal
        information, or they may come with malicious attachments that can infect a recipients computer with
        malware. Phishers
        may use email addresses that appear similar to legitimate ones but have subtle differences,
        impersonating
        well-known
        organizations to add credibility to their messages.

    <h1 style="color:white; font-family: Comic Sans MS; margin-left: 4cm; font-size: 25px"> Example </h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <!-- Images with 8cm margin on both sides -->
    <div class="images">
        <img src="email_1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
    </div>


    <p style="color:white;">
        The ultimate goal of email phishing is to steal sensitive information, including usernames, passwords,
        credit
        card details, and social security numbers. Once they have this data, phishers can engage in identity
        theft,
        financial fraud, or unauthorized access to accounts. Phishing attacks can be broad, targeting a large
        number
        of
        individuals,
        or highly targeted, focusing on specific individuals or organizations.

        To protect themselves from email phishing, users should be cautious about clicking on links or
        downloading
        attachments in emails. They should verify the senders email address, look for signs of phishing, such
        as
        misspelled words or odd requests, and use email filtering and security software. Reporting phishing
        emails
        to
        email service
        providers or impersonated organizations is also essential in combating these threats.</p>
