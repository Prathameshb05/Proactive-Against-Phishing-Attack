    <h1 style="color:white; font-family: Comic Sans MS; margin-left: 1cm; font-size: 30px"> SMS PHISHING
        INFORMATION
    </h1><br><br>
    <p>Smishing is a social engineering attack that uses fake mobile text messages to trick people into downloading
        malware,
        sharing sensitive information, or sending money to cybercriminals. The term “smishing” is a combination of
        “SMS”—or
        “short message service,” the technology behind text messages—and “phishing.”
        With smishing, cybercriminals use a text message to try to get potential victims to give out personal
        information. The
        text message, which typically contains a link to a fake website that looks identical to the legitimate site,
        asks the
        recipient to enter personal information. Fake information is often used to make the texts appear to be from
        a legitimate
        organization or business.

        Smishing has grown in popularity with cybercriminals now that smartphones are widely used, as it enables
        them to steal
        sensitive financial and personal information without having to break through the security defenses of a
        computer or
        network. Public awareness about phishing, smishing and other attacks continues to grow, as many incidents
        are reported
        on in the news.

    <p style="color:white;">
        Smishing attacks are similar to other types of phishing attacks, in which scammers use phony messages and
        malicious
        links to fool people into compromising their mobile phones, bank accounts, or personal data. The only main
        difference is
        the medium. In smishing attacks, scammers use SMS or messaging apps to conduct their cybercrimes rather than
        emails or
        phone calls.

        Scammers choose smishing over other types of phishing attacks for various reasons. Perhaps most importantly,
        research
        shows that people are likelier to click links in text messages. Klaviyo reports that SMS click-through rates
        hover
        between 8.9 percent and 14.5 percent (link resides outside ibm.com). By comparison, emails have an average
        click rate of
        only 1.33 percent, according to Constant Contact (link resides outside ibm.com).</p>
