        WEBSITE
        PHISHING
        INFORMATION
    </h1><br><br>
    <p>Website phishing, also known as
        phishing attacks or online
        phishing, is a type of
        cybercrime where attackers
        attempt to trick individuals into revealing their sensitive and personal information, such as usernames,
        passwords,credit card numbers, or other financial information, by impersonating a legitimate website or
        organization. The primary goal of phishing is to steal valuable data for fraudulent purposes, including
        identity theft, financial fraud, or unauthorized access to accounts.In its most basic form, URL phishing happens
        when a criminal sends someone a legitimate-looking email, which then
        entices the recipient to take action by clicking on a link that redirects them to what seems to be a company's
        official
        website. Once there, the unsuspecting victim will be required to enter personal or financial information.

        Often, a sense of urgency, such as a fast-approaching deadline, is involved to pressure the user into meeting
        the
        perpetrator's demands. Some fake URLs actually redirect to the legitimate site after personal information has
        been
        entered. This way, the target does not immediately realize they have been duped.

    <p style="color:white;font-family: Comic Sans MS">Phishing is typically carried out through deceptive emails, fake
        websites, or messages
        that appear to be from
        trusted
        sources, but are actually from malicious actors seeking to exploit unsuspecting individuals. It's essential
        to be
        cautious and verify the authenticity of websites and communications to protect yourself from phishing
        threats.<br><br>

        Three Common URL Phishing Techniques
        Although phishing awareness has vastly improved over the years, phishers are evolving their techniques to get
        past
        defenses. Here are some of the methods they are likely to try:
        <br><br>
        1. Mixing Legitimate Links with Malicious Links
        Since many email applications can sift out emails with malicious links, phishers will try including at least one
        legitimate link along with the bogus one(s). That way, the email passes the email programs defenses. They may
        also use a legitimate business or organizational logo to make the message appear real.
        <br><br>
        2. Abusing Redirects
        Some phishing URLs may prompt the user for sensitive information. Once these have been entered, the user is then
        redirected to the legitimate site.
        <br><br>
        3. Obfuscating Malware with Images
        Some filters scan the text in an email for malware, so phishers sometimes use images and graphics to hide the
        text and get past filters.<br><br><br>
