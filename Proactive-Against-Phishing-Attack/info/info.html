    </h1><br>
    <br>


    <div id="example1">
        <p>Spear phishing is a highly targeted form of phishing designed to deceive individuals or organizations into
            revealing
            sensitive information. Unlike regular phishing, a broad and untargeted approach, spear phishing is a highly
            personalized
            attack aimed at specific individuals, businesses, or roles within an organization.

            The spear phisher begins by gathering detailed information about the intended target, often using social
            engineering
            techniques. This can include information gleaned from public sources like social media, corporate websites,
            or industry
            publications. The information can include topics surrounding the recipient’s expertise, role in the
            organization,
            interests, and public and residential tax information. The attacker then uses this information to craft a
            convincing and
            seemingly legitimate communication, often an email, that appears to come from a trusted source like a
            well-known
            business partner, a colleague, or a socially significant contact.

            These specific details make the email appear more legitimate and increase the chances of the recipient
            clicking links or
            downloading attachments.

    </h1>

    <div id="example1">
        <p>A whaling attack is a method used by cybercriminals to masquerade as a senior player at an organization and
            directly
            target senior or other important individuals at an organization, with the aim of stealing money or sensitive
            information
            or gaining access to their computer systems for criminal purposes. Also known as CEO fraud, whaling is
            similar to
            phishing in that it uses methods such as email and website spoofing to trick a target into performing
            specific actions,
            such as revealing sensitive data or transferring money.

            Whereas phishing scams target non-specific individuals and spear-phishing targets particular individuals,
            whaling
            doubles down on the latter by not only targeting those key individuals, but doing so in a way that the
            fraudulent
            communications they are sent appear to have come from someone specifically senior or influential at their
            organization.
            Think of them as "big phish" or "whales" at the company, such as the CEO or finance manager. This adds an
            extra element
            of social engineering into the mix, with staff reluctant to refuse a request from someone they deem to be
            important.

    </h1>

    <div id="example1">
        <p>Angler phishing is a new scam technique where cyber actors masquerade as customer support staff using social
            media
            platforms and accounts. The mission is to trick dissatisfied customers into revealing personal details.

            An angler phishing attack got its name from an aquatic creature, the angler fish – a fish that hunts other
            fish. It has
            a luminescent fin ray that lures prey in before devouring them.

            Angler phishing attackers use the same tactics to fish for their prey. They create false social media
            accounts of top
            companies, particularly financial institutions.

            Dissatisfied users trying to contact companies via Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram are captured by angler
            phishers. They
            ask victims to complete specific tasks to redirect them to malicious, attacker-controlled sites

    </h1>

    <div id="example1">
        <p>Pop-up phishing involves fraudulent messages that “pop up” for users when they are surfing the web. In many
            cases cyber
            criminals infect otherwise legitimate websites with malicious code that causes these pop-up messages to
            appear when
            people visit them.

            The content of these messages is what makes them so effective. Often, they present the unsuspecting website
            visitor with
            some kind of fraudulent warning, typically about the security of their computer. Then they either prompt the
            visitor to
            download some necessary tool to fix the problem, such as an antivirus application which turns out to be
            malware itself,
            or to call a fraudulent phone number for “support.” This latter tactic seems to have become more common
            recently, as the
            following example illustrates.

        PHISHING
    </h1>


    <div id="example1">
        <p>An evil twin attack is a spoofing cyberattack that tricks users into connecting to a fake Wi-Fi access point
            that mimics
            a legitimate network. Once a user is connected to an evil twin access point, hackers can access everything
            from their
            network traffic to private login credentials.

            Evil twin attacks get their name from their ability to imitate legitimate Wi-Fi networks to the extent that
            they are
            indistinguishable from one another. Hackers create these false networks to trick unsuspecting users into
            logging in and
            accessing user data to steal personal information and commit crimes. This is especially dangerous for users
            who use the
            same username and password for multiple accounts since the hacker could gain access to all of them by
            monitoring just
            one login attempt. What’s worse, these attacks are nearly impossible to identify.
