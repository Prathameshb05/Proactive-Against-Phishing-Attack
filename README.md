# 🔐 Proactive Against Phishing Attack

## 🧩 Project Overview

**Proactive Against Phishing Attack** is a frontend-based project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to detect and prevent phishing threats in real-time. It scans user-submitted URLs, checks them against known phishing patterns, and alerts users if suspicious behavior is detected — all within the browser.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time URL scanning and validation
- Pattern matching to detect suspicious links
- Visual warnings for potentially malicious websites
- Clean and responsive user interface

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

## 📖 How It Works

1. User inputs or clicks on a URL.
2. JavaScript validates the URL structure and checks for suspicious patterns (e.g., misspelled domains, use of IP addresses, known keywords).
3. If the link seems unsafe, a warning message is displayed.
4. Safe links allow normal navigation or interaction.
